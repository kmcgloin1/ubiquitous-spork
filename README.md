This project aims to determine the efficiency of Halal broiler production in Indonesia, Malaysia, 
and Thailand by measuring the production price of Halal between 1991 and 2009. We utilize the 
statistical techniques of ANOVA to determine if there are any statistically significant differences 
between the average production price of the three countries. Furthermore, using pairwise t-tests 
and Tukeyâ€™s HSD Test, we illustrate where any difference between the average production price lies 
amongst the three countries.
